# Simple Python "Higher or Lower" Game

This is a basic text-based "Higher or Lower" game implemented in Python. In this game, you will be presented with two options (e.g., celebrities, brands, or social media accounts), and your goal is to guess which option has more followers. The game will continue until you make an incorrect guess.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/P4R4D0X-HACKS/higherlower.git

### Game Rules
- You will be presented with two options, and each option will have a follower count.
- Guess which option has more followers by typing "A" or "B."
- If you guess correctly, the game continues with new options.
- If you guess incorrectly, the game ends, and your final score will be displayed.
- Try to achieve the highest score possible by making correct guesses in a row.
